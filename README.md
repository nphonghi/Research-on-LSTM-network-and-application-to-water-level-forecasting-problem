# Research on LSTM network and application to water level forecasting problem
The project focuses on researching the LSTM Encoder-Decoder deep learning model, a powerful architecture for time series processing, to address the problem of water level forecasting at the Le Thuy hydrological station in Quang Binh, Vietnam. The water levels are predicted based on historical input data such as water level, rainfall, and tidal information from multiple hydrological stations. The aim is to support effective flood warning and prevention in the context of climate change and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events.
