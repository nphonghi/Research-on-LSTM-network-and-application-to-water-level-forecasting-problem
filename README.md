# Research-on-LSTM-network-and-application-to-water-level-forecasting-problem
This project investigates the LSTM Encoder-Decoder model for forecasting water levels at the Le Thuy hydrological station in Quang Binh. Using past data on water levels, rainfall, and tides from multiple stations, it aims to improve flood warning and prevention amid increasing extreme weather events.
